We realized and valued the significance of saving lives in our career and                                    how we can make a difference in person›s life. I was really impressed by                                    the hospital’s different fields in pharmacy, that made me appreciated our                                    career more with the critical thinking for the necessary of future planning                                    from our first year at the faculty.

Samia  Raed                                      It was my first time to visit the EgyptAir Hospital, which was something                                    completely new for me, and I learned my area of expertise well. What can                                    we do to aid the patient? Now, the clinical pharmacists and physicians work                                    together, and pharmacists are responsible for selecting the right medicines                                    in the right dose, with other safety circumferences, while the physician’s                                    role is to make diagnoses. Additionally, I was aware that, there are many                                    lovely specialties to which we can apply after graduation. The layout of                                    each segment is one of the things that particularly attracted my eyes.

I was hearing theoretically about the fields                                    of clinical pharmacy, but I imagined that this is not available in Egypt                                    or even very few. While after this visit, I appreciated my faculty more,                                    and  my  passion  was  increased.  I  felt  that  I  had  a  lot  of  opportunities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    that  were  never  limited  to  a  pharmacy  career,  as  I  had  imagined.

Nada Sameh                                       Indeed, it was an amazing day in which we learned about the different                                    specialties  of  our  pharmacy  field  and  what  we  will  add  to  the  society                                    and  the  labor  market  after  graduation.  Really,  I  want  to  thank  all  the                                    hospital  staff  for  their  efforts.  I  also  introduce  my  great  thanks  for  our                                    staff that are reasonable for the clinical pharmacy program at Mansoura                                    National University, with their hard efforts they always do to benefit their                                    students and for graduate higher quality staff that will help significantly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    the  Egyptian  society  and  will  cope  with  the  labor  developments.                                                                                       Youssef  Hisham                                       As regards the “Egypt Aviation Hospital” visit, I learned that the pharmacist                                    was never a seller; on the contrary, he plays a significant role in the health                                    sector that cannot be replaced by any other health professional, as some                                    people thought. Clinical pharmacists’ role is very critical as it interferes with                                    saving patients’ lives after God Almighty. Our work deserves appreciation,                                    especially in the clinical pharmacy field.

Q2: How did the spirit of cooperation between you at the team? Were there difficulties among you              or not ?

Then  we  decided                                   on our words. Also, we wanted                 to  participate  in  the  Delta                            to  learn,  and  we  were  all                 University Student Conference                              originally joined for this goal.                 to  see  if  we  could  overcome                           At the end we trained for how                 this fear barrier. We of course                            to work in teams and navigate                 were  quite  successful.

Added to this, the faculty, from its first year, provided many                                    different excellent activities and we were keen on participating at more                                    than one of them, such as the Scientific Team. By joining this team, we                                    were allowed to attend conferences that we won two places there.

God willing, the way of teaching is trying to simplify                                    everything, and we know how to communicate with doctors very easily                                    who are all supportive. Beyond this, the faculty offered us many seminars                                    from  which  we  gained  a  lot  of  information. Added  to  the  very  useful                                    scientific events held on the faculty’s floor as “The 1st student scientific                                    Day”  and  “Pharmacovigilance  awareness  Day”.

Something like “pharmacovigilance                                    awareness day” or “how do we make a resume”. We learned and gained                                    more experience from the first year. Honestly, the doctors are excellent,                                    we  know  how  to  talk  and  communicate  well  with  them.  Everything  is                                    excellent.

The  professors  are  very  good,  respectful,  and  deal  with  us  very  well.                                    They  also  help  us  a  lot  with  our  problems.  In  addition,  the  university                                    organizes many activities, such as seminars and other events, that benefit                                    us by providing new information and helping us discover new skills.

Personally, I have discovered new things, made many friends, and                                    continued to participate in all activities. I love the university very much,                                    including the professors, workers, colleagues, and friends.

I have become a lot more open-minded than                                    the heritage I was born into. Our professors are super helpful, genuine, and                                    very successful in their tasks.

Abstract               Background:  Lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  an              endotoxin  within  gram-negative  bacteria,  is              associated  with  systemic  acute  inflammatory              response after invading living tissues and results              in sepsis. The liver and kidney are both major              target organs in sepsis. Septic acute hepatic-renal              injury is a serious clinical condition with high              risk  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  Nevertheless,              effective treatment is still lacking.
